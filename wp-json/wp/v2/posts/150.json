Carleton Credit Union, in collaboration with Visa, offers valuable insights and tips to help you enjoy your travels while keeping your financial information secure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Notify Your Bank:<\/strong> Before you embark on your journey, inform your bank or credit union about your travel plans, including your destination and travel dates. This notification prevents your card from being flagged for suspicious activity when used in a foreign location.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Monitor Your Account:<\/strong> Regularly check your account for any unauthorized or suspicious transactions. Most financial institutions, including Carleton Credit Union, offer online and mobile banking services that enable you to monitor your account conveniently while traveling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Use a Travel Wallet:<\/strong> Consider using a separate travel wallet to keep your Visa card, passport, and other important documents secure. This dedicated wallet minimizes the risk of losing or misplacing your cards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Beware of ATMs:<\/strong> When using ATMs abroad, choose those located within banks or reputable financial institutions. Skimming devices are less likely to be attached to ATMs in secure locations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Use Secure Wi-Fi:<\/strong> Only make online transactions on secure Wi-Fi networks, and avoid public or unsecured networks. Using a virtual private network (VPN) can add an extra layer of security to your online activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. EMV Chip and PIN:<\/strong> Carleton Credit Union Visa cards are equipped with EMV chip technology, which provides enhanced security during transactions. Ensure you know your card&#8217;s PIN for any situations where a PIN is required, especially at automated kiosks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Contactless Payments:<\/strong> If your Visa card supports contactless payments, take advantage of this feature to minimize physical contact with card readers, reducing the risk of card skimming.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Keep Copies of Important Documents:<\/strong> Photocopy or digitally scan your passport, Visa card, and other vital documents. Store these copies separately from the originals in case of loss or theft.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Emergency Contact Information:<\/strong> Save the contact information for your bank or credit union, including a 24\/7 international contact number. In case of a lost or stolen card, you can quickly report the incident and request assistance.<\/p>\n<p>By taking these precautionary steps, you can confidently use your Visa card while traveling, ensuring both your financial security and peace of mind. Carleton Credit Union is committed to providing its members with the resources and support needed to make their journeys memorable and secure. Travel safely and enjoy the incredible experiences the world has to offer.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t just save money, make more money with a checking account from us. &#8211; Franklin Traveling can be a thrilling experience, but it&#8217;s essential to ensure the safety and security of your financial transactions, especially when using your Visa card abroad.
